```

### **Security Considerations for Robots.txt**
- ✅ **Sensitive API endpoints**: Blocked via `/api/` disallow
- ✅ **Admin areas**: Protected via `/admin/` and `/dashboard/` disallow
- ✅ **Authentication**: Secured via `/auth/` disallow
- ✅ **Internal documentation**: Restricted via `/docs/internal/` disallow
- ✅ **Development environments**: Blocked via `/staging/`, `/dev/`, `/test/` disallow
- ✅ **Configuration files**: Protected via file type and `/config/` disallow
- ✅ **Public content**: Explicitly allowed for SEO optimization
